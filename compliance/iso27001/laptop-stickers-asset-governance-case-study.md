## Executive Summary

This case study documents a real-world incident involving the application of stickers on a company-issued laptop in a regulated fintech environment.

The IT team flagged the action as an unauthorized modification of a company asset, citing the need to maintain:

- uniformity of corporate devices, and  
- professional standards for reassignment and audits.

Although no security or operational impact occurred, the incident primarily revealed a critical governance issue:

> **A communication and policy visibility gap regarding asset usage guidelines.**

The lack of clearly documented and communicated rules resulted in unintentional non-compliance.

## Organization Context

- **Industry:** Fintech  
- **Environment:**
  - ISO 27001–aligned ISMS  
  - Centrally managed company-issued laptops  
  - Formal IT asset management process  
  - Office-based corporate usage  

---

## Incident Summary

An employee applied a few stickers to a company-issued laptop for personalization.

The laptop had been in regular office use for several months without any prior warning or communication regarding restrictions on such modifications.

Later, the IT support team sent an email stating that:

- personal modifications to company assets are not permitted, and  
- laptops should remain in their original condition to maintain uniformity and professional standards.

At the time of the incident, the employee was unaware of any written policy or guideline prohibiting stickers on company devices.

The stickers were removed immediately after the notification.

---

## Reason Provided by IT (As per Official Communication)

The IT team cited:

- preservation of company asset condition  
- uniform appearance across corporate devices  
- professional standards for workplace equipment  
- ease of future reassignment and audits  

No technical or security incident was reported.

## Root Cause Analysis – What Went Wrong

| Area | Observation | Impact |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Policy Visibility | No documented rule shared regarding laptop personalization | Employees unaware of restriction |
| Communication | No onboarding or asset-usage briefing on physical modifications | Assumptions based on past practice |
| Enforcement Consistency | Stickers went unnoticed for months | Created perception of acceptability |
| Documentation Access | Asset guidelines not easily accessible | Preventable misunderstanding |

---

## Communication Gap Analysis

The incident did not arise from negligence or intent to violate policy, but from missing governance communication.

Key gaps identified:

- No written policy explicitly stating that stickers or personal modifications were prohibited  
- No onboarding or IT awareness session covering physical asset handling rules  
- No internal knowledge base or handbook describing acceptable asset usage  
- No proactive communication before enforcement  

As a result, the employee reasonably assumed that minor personalization was acceptable.

From an IT governance perspective:

> A rule that is not documented or communicated cannot function as an effective control.

---

## Additional Information Security Perspective

While the original concern was related to asset governance and professionalism, physical modifications to corporate devices can also introduce indirect security considerations such as:

- visual identification of corporate devices in public spaces  
- potential disclosure of employee interests or technical domain  
- increased targeting for theft or social engineering  
- complications during device reassignment  

These aspects fall under ISO 27001 physical security and asset management controls, even though they were not cited as the primary reason in this incident.

---

## Outcome

- The employee removed the stickers from the laptop immediately after notification.  
- No corrective or disciplinary action was initiated by the IT or security team.

---

## Best Practice Recommendations

### For Organizations

- Clearly document asset modification rules in asset usage policies  
- Communicate physical asset handling standards during onboarding  
- Maintain an accessible internal policy repository  
- Apply consistent enforcement across teams  
- Avoid relying on assumed or informal rules  

---

## Key Takeaway

Security and IT governance is not limited to systems and networks.

It also depends on:

- how rules are documented,  
- how clearly they are communicated, and  
- how consistently they are applied.

This case demonstrates that:

> **Communication gaps can undermine governance even when technical risk is low.**

Clear policy visibility is essential to prevent unintentional non-compliance and workplace friction.
