## Business Logic Flaw in Payment Flow – Parameter Manipulation

## Summary
A business logic vulnerability was identified in the payment workflow where client-side parameters could be manipulated to alter the transaction amount before payment processing.

## Impact
- Unauthorized payment amount modification
- Financial loss
- Fraud risk
- Compliance violation (PCI-DSS)

## Environment
- Application Type: E-commerce Web Application
- Payment Gateway: Third-party
- Testing Type: Black-box

## Vulnerability Details
The application trusted price-related parameters sent from the client without proper server-side validation.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Add a product to cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Intercept the payment request using Burp Suite
4. Modify the `amount` parameter
5. Forward the request
6. Observe successful payment with manipulated value

## Proof of Concept
POST /payment
amount=1
product_id=123

## Root Cause
Lack of server-side validation for sensitive transaction parameters.

## Risk Rating
High

## Remediation
- Validate price on server side
- Use product IDs instead of price values
- Implement integrity checks
- Add monitoring and alerts

## Lessons Learned
Client-side data must never be trusted for business-critical operations.
